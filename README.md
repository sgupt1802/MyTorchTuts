# PyTorch Tutorials and Experiments

Welcome to the PyTorch Tutorials and Experiments repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of tutorials, experiments, and projects aimed at mastering the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## About PyTorch

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a popular open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph, making it ideal for building and training deep neural networks.

### Key Features of PyTorch:
- **Dynamic Computational Graph**: PyTorch uses a dynamic computation graph, allowing for dynamic changes during runtime. This enables more flexibility in model construction and debugging.
- **GPU Acceleration**: PyTorch provides seamless GPU acceleration, making it efficient for training deep learning models on GPUs.
- **Automatic Differentiation**: PyTorch's `autograd` module enables automatic differentiation of tensor operations, simplifying the process of computing gradients for optimization.
- **Pythonic Interface**: PyTorch offers a Pythonic interface, making it easy to learn and use for Python developers. It integrates well with other Python libraries and frameworks.

## What's Included

### 1. Basics of PyTorch
- **Introduction to PyTorch**: Learn the fundamentals of PyTorch, including tensors, operations, and automatic differentiation.
- **Building Neural Networks**: Explore building neural networks using PyTorch's `nn` module, including fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers.

### 2. Experiments (Done and Upcoming)
- **Image Classification**: Building a Deep Neural Network from the scratch and training it, making predictions on the train and test set.
- **Image Classification**: Build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks using popular datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.
- **Text Classification**: Experiment with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) for text classification tasks.
